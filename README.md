# Temperature-meter
the temperature sensor captures temperature as an analog signal. The internal ADC then converts this signal into a digital format. The resulting digital signal is interpreted to identify the voltage initially detected by the temperature sensor. This voltage is further processed through a coded equation to obtain a decimal value, which is finally displayed on the LCD screen.

The process of selecting the unit of temperature measurement is:
1) pick 1 if you want the temperature with Celsius or pick 2 if you want the temperature with Fahrenheit.
2) pick ON/c if you want to change the unit of temperature measurement
