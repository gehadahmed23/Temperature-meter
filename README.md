# Temperature-meter
Temperature display in lcd
the temperature sensor captures temperature as an analog signal. The internal ADC then converts this signal into a digital format. The resulting digital signal is interpreted to identify the voltage initially detected by the temperature sensor. This voltage is further processed through a coded equation to obtain a decimal value, which is finally displayed on the LCD screen.
